# Ali Radman

**Cybersecurity Analyst** focused on offensive security, red teaming, and detection engineering.  
eJPT certified. Building a portfolio of real-world attack simulations, documentation-first playbooks, and defensive detections.

## Summary

I design lab-grade attack paths that map directly to detections and mitigations. My work emphasizes clarity for reviewers: each technique includes telemetry, SIEM queries, and hardening steps.

## Skills

- **Attack & Discovery:** AD abuse, Kerberos attacks (Kerberoast, AS-REP), NTLM relay, delegation abuse, lateral movement
- **Detection Engineering:** Windows Eventing, Sysmon, Sigma, Splunk query design
- **Tools:** Nmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit, CrackMapExec, Impacket, Responder, mitm6, BloodHound, Wireshark, Hydra, Gobuster, winPEAS/linPEAS
- **Scripting:** Python, Bash
- **Platforms:** Windows, Linux, AD/LDAP, Web apps

## Featured Projects

- **Active Directory Attack Playbook — Red ↔ Blue**  
  Documentation-first repo covering high-probability AD attack paths with detections and mitigations. Includes Mermaid network diagram, event IDs, Splunk queries, and Sigma examples.  
  _Playbooks:_ Kerberoasting → DCSync, AS-REP Roasting, NTLM Relay (mitm6), ADCS ESC1 → PKINIT, Delegation Abuse, Credential Access (LSASS/SAM/DPAPI/Browser), Password Reuse, Process-memory strings leakage, Default/Shared Local Creds.  
  Repo: https://github.com/3LiRad/ad-attack-playbook

- **PNPT-Style Attack Lab (ongoing)**  
  External → internal pivot → AD abuse → DC impact, fully documented with detections and mitigations.  
  

- **Simple SSH Honeypot (Python)**  
  Lightweight honeypot that logs unauthorized SSH attempts and attacker commands for basic telemetry and enrichment.  
  Repo: https://github.com/3LiRad/Simple-SSH-Honeypot

- **Personal Website**  
  Portfolio site (GitHub Pages + Tailwind) to showcase projects and certifications.  
  Repo: https://github.com/3LiRad/3LiRad.github.io
